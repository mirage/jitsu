(** Just-In-Time Summoning of Unikernels.

    Jitsu is a forwarding DNS server that automatically starts
    unikernel VMs when their domain is requested.  The DNS response is
    sent to the client after the unikernel has started, enabling the
    client to use unmodified software to communicate with unikernels
    that are started on demand. If no DNS requests are received for
    the unikernel within a given timeout period, the VM is
    automatically stopped. *)

(** Iterate through the internal VM table and stop VMs that haven't
    received requests for more than [ttl*2] seconds. *)
